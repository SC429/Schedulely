        Welcome to Schedulely. We have created Schedulely with the purpose of
        helping students create their perfect semester schedule without the
        stress.

      <p>
        Having trouble creating the perfect schedule for the upcoming semester?
        Is your 1pm Calculus class clashing with your 1pm GPA-Booster class?
        Do you need help fitting all the classes you want to take in a manageable schedule?
        Then you came to the right place. As fellow students, we know the struggle of trying to
        fit all the necessary classes into the perfect schedule. Trying to choose the right
        class section for your required major classes so that you can squeeze in classes that
        you have interest in. But even with the perfect schedule, we've all experienced the dreaded
        feeling when enrollment period opens and then, BAM, some of your classes
        filled up within seconds. Now you sit there, thinking how life is unfair,
        how you will never find the perfect replacement class that works with your schedule,
        and how you will now have to dropout of college (just kidding).
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to worry! We created Schedulely to help you with your semester scheduling
        woes. By inputting all the class sections that you want to take, Schedulely
        will provide you with all the different combination of classes that satisfy
        the times. But what if there are some classes that you would need to take?
        Schedulely also allows you to specify which class section that you want to
        take when you input in your classes. Don't believe me? Well try it for yourself then.
